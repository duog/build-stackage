* Summary
A shell script to build all of stackage with a ghc release candidate using
stackage-curator.

We use a fork at https://github.com/duog/stackage-curator in a submodule to fix
small bugs, and to allow patching packages to compile with the new ghc version.

The script run.sh builds and installs stackage-curator in a docker container
(snoyberg/stackage:latest) with the ghc specified in this repositories
stack.yaml. It then installs the release candidate and runs stackage-curator in
the container. Output goes to ./work by default.

To install latest release of stack: curl -sSL https://get.haskellstack.org/ | sh

Due to [https://github.com/fpco/stackage-curator/issues/50], ghc-8.2
nightlies will currently not work. Not to fear, we can generate our own nightly
from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fpco/stackage/master/build-constraints.yaml.
This will be fine unless the resulting plan is broken.
