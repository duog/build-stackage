* Summary
A shell script to build all of stackage with a ghc release candidate using
stackage-curator.

We use a fork at https://github.com/duog/stackage-curator in a submodule to fix
small bugs, and to allow patching packages to compile with the new ghc version.

The script run.sh builds and installs stackage-curator in a docker container
(snoyberg/stackage:latest) with the ghc specified in this repositories
stack.yaml. It then installs the release candidate and runs stackage-curator in
the container. Output goes to ./work

To install latest release of stack: curl -sSL https://get.haskellstack.org/ | sh

Some builds fail due to missing executables, for example language-c fails due to
missing happy. I would expect that if one let the process run to completion, and
reran it, that those errors would be resolved on the second running.
